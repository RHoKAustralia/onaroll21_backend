<h2><strong>Playing On A Roll</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Roll the dice once each day during the 21-day program, including weekends, <strong>preferably after you get up in the morning</strong>, and read your randomly-generated activity. You will be alerted when you have reached day 21</li>
	<li>Plan when and how you will carry out your day's activity; what you need to scan for during the day, what photo you will take, or what link or comment you will post. Be imaginative, be devious, be generous, but <strong>be committed</strong> so you can get maximum value out of the program</li>
	<li>When carrying out your activity for the day, please keep in mind some golden rules of social media etiquette:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Respect privacy at all times: e.g. obtain permission before posting revealing pictures of others, especially colleagues, or avoid posting information that may be deemed sensitive by others. This includes respecting your own privacy by not oversharing or revealing information that may hurt your reputation</li>
	<li>Keep it positive and constructive: you are in a small group, so be mindful that your interactions are very likely to inspire others</li>
	<li>Don't get too distracted! Each activity is designed to take 5-10 minutes maximum. If it takes any longer, either think of an easier way to approach the challenge or save the activity for the weekend and reroll for today</li>
	<li>Observe your organisation's social media policy and/or organisational values and code of conduct</li>
	<li>Report any inappropriate behaviour or distressing content to the <a href="mailto:support@enmasse.com.au">support team</a> (if you're in Australia call 03 9827 1388) who will promptly address.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>At the end of the day or before you leave work, post your response to the activity</li>
	<li>Review your team members' posts from the day, either after you post your own or while you're heading home from work; select the Favourite button against the ones you like the most</li>
	<li>At the conclusion (day 21) you will be directed to a confidential post-survey. Please complete as this will help us measure the effectiveness of the program</li>
	<li>Email the <a href="mailto:support@enmasse.com.au">support team</a> (or if you're in Australia call 03 9827 1388) if you experience any technical issues. Happy rolling!</li>
